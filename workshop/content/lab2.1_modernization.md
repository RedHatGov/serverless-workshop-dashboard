# Modernization
When the lab instructors were extolling the virtues of serverless, you might have been thinking "we can’t just leave legacy behind and go cloud-native!"
No you can’t - most folks aren't developing 100% new apps. You might have legacy data, legacy applications, and there are often a myriad of reasons those won't get re-written. *Modernization isn’t about adopting new technologies and practices, it is about what happens to the old ones*.

So focus modernization on what you have. Your main goals should be to use existing functionality and data in new applications as much as possible (deriving new value with old applications). And also to focus on bringing the benefits of new processes, products, and technologies to old applications.

# Modernization Labs
You've already tried out some of the basic concepts in the intro labs, so now let's try something a bit more interesting. Don't worry, we are still keeping it simple. Let's apply the simple concepts to an existing application so you can see how to leverage it with legacy applications.
