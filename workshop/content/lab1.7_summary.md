# Summary

Well done!  You've successfully completed the introduction to OpenShift Serverless.  At this point, we've covered quite a bit of ground and hopefully at this point you can:

1. Understand and explain what is meant by "serverless"
2. Deploy a Serverless application
3. Connect a Serverless application to a Kafka topic
4. Rollout new revisions of Serverless applications

In future labs, you'll take what you learned today and apply it towards a deeper dive into a very popular use case for Serverless technology, machine learning.
