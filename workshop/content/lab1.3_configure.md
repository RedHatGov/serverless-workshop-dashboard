# Setup

As a preqrequisite to running these labs, you will need access to an OpenShift v4.x cluster as a cluster admin.  We also assume you have the `oc` client installed and have logged into your cluster with it.

OpenShift Serverless install can be completely done with Operator Hub webconsole or the CLI - we are going to give you a little taste of both by adding the operator via webconsole and then the rest via CLI

## Knative Serving
Knative serving has already been installed for you.  Verify it now.

1.  Verify installation
```
oc get knativeserving.operator.knative.dev/knative-serving \
  -n knative-serving \
  --template='{{range .status.conditions}}{{printf "%s=%s\n" .type .status}}{{end}}'
```

The output will look like:

```
DependenciesInstalled=True
DeploymentsAvailable=True
InstallSucceeded=True
Ready=True
```

2.  Verify serving pods

```
oc get pods -n knative-serving
```

You should see something like the following:
```

## Tools

### `kn` CLI

`kn` is a very powerful tool for being able to control knative from the command line. Verify that you have it installed by running:

```
kn version
```

### `stern` CLI

`stern` is a great tool to easily be able to view logs for a particular container.  Verify that you have it installed by running:

```
stern -v
```
